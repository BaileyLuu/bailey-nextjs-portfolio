    description: `KubeHuddle is the first professional event which I was honoured to be part as an organizer (as I was an attendee in 2023).
    
    With countless hours of planning (logistics, marketing, techical) and constant ideation/communication/execution/collaboration with amazing team, we were able to bring 200+ attendees networking, speakers sharing their insights, and sponsors showcasing their products! 
    
    I worked on designing the social media posters/banners graphics using Canva, editing the promotional videos using CapCut and Instagram Reels, drafting the event schedule to coordinating with sponsors/speakers, and developing a project using Ticket Tailor API for badge creation and event stats (e.g dietary restrictions stats).

    Although it was a 6-month intensive organizing process, but I enjoyed every moment of it and learned so much from both behavioural and technical aspects.

    description: `As a Logistics Executive, I was responsible for developing event schedule sand judging criterias, designing swag bags, and creating informational packages for volunteers, hackers, mentors, judges, and sponsors to ensure everyone understood their roles and responsibilities.

    Aside from the logistics, I also worked on ElleHacks informational Discord Bot to keep track of attendees' check-ins, automatically assigned roles, and get the event information (e.g schedules/faqs). The bot helped to reduce manual work.
